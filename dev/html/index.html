      <h1>Help Save Our Oceans</h1>
      <p>
        Ocean Pollution is a serious issue that is affecting our beaches, our
        oceans, ocean dwellers worldwide, and our own health. The Majority of
        these pollutants come from human activity on land and it’s our job to do
        something about it.
      </p>
      <h2>Types of Pollution</h2>
      <h3>Chemical Pollution</h3>
      <p>
        The majority of pollutants going into the ocean come from activities on
        land. Natural processes and human activities along the coastlines and
        far inland affect the health of our ocean. One of the biggest sources is
        called nonpoint source pollution, which occurs as a result of runoff.
        Nonpoint source pollution includes many small sources, like septic
        tanks, cars, trucks, and boats, plus larger sources, such as farms,
        livestock ranches, and timber harvest areas. Pollution that comes from a
        single source, like an oil or chemical spill, is known as point source
        pollution. Often these events have large impacts, but fortunately, they
        occur less often. Discharge from faulty or damaged factories or water
        treatment systems is also considered point source pollution. The oil and
        gas industry’s routine operations emit toxic by-products, release high
        levels of greenhouse gases, and lead to thousands of spills in U.S.
        waters annually. That oil can linger for decades and do irreversible
        damage to delicate marine ecosystems. Take the BP Deepwater Horizon
        offshore drilling disaster in 2010, which spread millions of gallons of
        oil throughout the Gulf of Mexico. But even smaller spills pollute the
        ocean (and the air) with long-lasting impacts. Even the most advanced
        cleanup efforts remove only a fraction of the oil, and sometimes they
        use hazardous technologies. Chemical dispersants used in the largest
        spill response efforts—1.8 million gallons were released into the Gulf
        after the BP disaster—are dangerous pollutants themselves.
      </p>
      <h3>Ocean Acidification</h3>
      <p>
        Today’s seas absorb as much as a quarter of all man-made carbon
        emissions, which changes the pH of surface waters and leads to
        acidification. Ocean acidification causes changes to carbonate levels
        within the ocean offsetting the ecosystem and endangering clams, corals,
        and oysters. Increased acidity levels also interfere with some creatures
        ability to hunt or detect predators. This is felt in human societies as
        well. The billion-dollar American shellfish industry helps support many
        coastal communities but has lost millions of dollars as a result of
        pollution resulting in the loss of thousands of jobs
      </p>

      <h3>Trash in the Ocean</h3>
      <p>
        The majority of the garbage that enters the ocean each year is
        plastic—and here to stay. That’s because unlike other trash, the
        single-use grocery bags, water bottles, drinking straws, and yogurt
        containers, among eight million metric tons of the plastic items we toss
        (instead of recycle), won’t biodegrade. Instead, they can persist in the
        environment for a millennium, polluting our beaches, entangling marine
        life, and getting ingested by fish and seabirds. While some of this
        debris is dumped directly into the seas, an estimated 80 percent of
        marine litter makes its way there gradually from land-based
        sources―including those far inland―via storm drains, sewers, and other
        routes. Oil from boats, airplanes, cars, trucks, and even lawn mowers is
        also swimming in ocean waters. Chemical discharges from factories, raw
        sewage overflow from water treatment systems, and stormwater and
        agricultural runoff add other forms of marine-poisoning pollutants to
        the toxic brew.
      </p>

      <h3>Ocean Noise</h3>
      <p>
        Sound waves travel farther and faster in the sea’s dark depths than they
        do in the air, and many marine mammals like whales and dolphins, in
        addition to fish and other sea creatures, rely on communication by sound
        to find food, mate, and navigate. But an increasing barrage of
        human-generated ocean noise pollution is altering the underwater
        acoustic landscape, harming—and even killing—marine species worldwide.
        in the hunt for offshore oil and gas, ships equipped with high-powered
        air guns fire compressed air into the water every 10 to 12 seconds for
        weeks to months on end. Traveling as far as 2,500 miles, these deafening
        seismic blasts disrupt foraging, mating, and other vital behaviors of
        endangered whales. High-intensity sonar used by the U.S. Navy for
        testing and training also causes a barrage of sound in underwater
        ecosystems. The underwater racket that results creates a kind of “smog”
        that reaches nearly every corner of the ocean and shrinks the sensory
        range of marine wildlife.

      <h2>What You Can Do To Help</h2>
      <p>
        The fate of our seas is not only up to the government or industry. Our
        individual, daily actions matter, too. You can start by reducing water
        pollution and runoff at home, being more mindful of your plastic
        consumption, or organizing a cleanup of your local waterway. You can
        also support the work of NRDC and other environmental advocacy groups as
        well as other businesses and organizations that work to preserve our
        coasts and waters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep trash and chemicals out of storm drains, including pet waste. Storm
        water flows into the sea, carrying pollutants which can lead to beach
        closures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plant a native or drought-tolerant plant garden. Native and
        drought-tolerant plants can help you reduce the use of water and
        fertilizers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plant an organic garden. Some chemical fertilizers and pesticides from
        lawns and gardens can wash into the ocean and contribute to water
        quality issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make your own mulch. Compost and use organic fertilizers only when
        needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recycle used motor oil. Don’t let motor oil spill on the ground because
        rain will wash it into the storm water drains, and from there out to the
        ocean, where it can harm or kill marine life. Find an oil-recycling
        center near you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dispose of household cleaners properly. Household cleaning products,
        paint, pesticides, fluorescent light bulbs, and batteries pose a threat
        to water quality. Find more information about free collection centers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check the labels of the personal care products. Including face and body
        wash, toothpaste and more, and stop using products containing
        polyethylene or polypropylene microbeads. #BanTheBead
